## Shell

What is a shell?

- A shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.
- Interprets the commands
- When we run `git` how does the computer know what to do? `git` is an executable file.
- Commandline interface that interprets commands and tells the OS what to do.

Types of Shells:
- Bourne Shell (sh)
- C Shell (csh)
- Z Shell (zsh) - "Oh my zsh"
- Bash Shell (bash)

## Root

- `root` is the username of the current user
- `@` is the seperator
- `number` is the hostname of the server
- `:/#` is the current directory
