# Computer Networking

**Computer Network** - In simple terms - Computers connected together.

**Internet** - Collection of computer networks.


## How internet started?

Cold war - United States and Soviet Union - Battle of technologies - Soviet Union created Sputnik - United States created ARPANET for communication - Advanced Research Projects Agency Network - First computer network.
(MIT - Stanford - UCLA - Utah)

- Used TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol) - For communication between computers.

- Previously missing automated sharing - Here WWW (World Wide Web) was introduced - Stores documents and information - Tim Berners-Lee - Published on web servers - Based on hyperlinking of web pages.

- No search engine - Couldn't search for things - Save things in indices but not search - Built search engines - Yahoo being the first.

- Protocols - Necessary for communication - Decisions made by the *Internet Society* - To make submissions use RFC (Request for Comments) - Idea/Features.


## Client-Server Architecture

- google.com - Client - Sends request to server - Server sends response - Client displays response.

- Connections over continents and countries are made under the ocean - Fiber optic cables - Light pulses - Faster than radio waves - Less interference - More bandwidth - More expensive.

- A computer can be both client and server - Example: when using localhost.

- Use `inspect element` to see Networks tab in Chrome - Shows requests and responses - Can see the time taken for each request.
